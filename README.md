With well over **10 themes** (light and dark) I think you will be able to find your favorite.
You can even find a theme that fits your mood for the day.

Variety is the spice of life! So you can choose themes from the following Doki-Doki Theme Suites:

- Doki-Doki Literature Club
- Re:Zero
- Kill La Kill
- KonoSuba
- DanganRonpa

Sticker in the way? No worries! You can configure them to be on or off at your leisure.

These themes are easy to install, there are minimal configurations, so you can enjoy the themes faster.
They also play well with other themes, so feel free to come and go as your mood changes :)
