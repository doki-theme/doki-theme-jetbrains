_Zero Two's Not Just A Cutie. ;)_

**4 New Themes!**

- I decided that I didn't have enough Zero Two themes, so I fixed that. She now has a new top-tier dark hacker theme: `Obsidian`. I also felt like Red Zero Two doesn't get enough attention, so I added a light `Sakura` theme which features her as she was as a child. With all these new Zero Two themes, I thought it would be best to rename the existing dark & light themes to \`Rose\` & \`Lily\` respectively.
- It wouldn't be the _Darling_ release if I didn't include Hiro as well. (Dark Theme)
- Lastly, this is the first release with a duo theme! (Nao's doesn't count, I just wanted the melon meme.) Just to pad my Zero Two theme stats, I've now got a Hiro & Zero Two couples' dark theme.

![v84 Girls](https://doki.assets.unthrottled.io/misc/v84_girls.png)

This release is not for my Dark Theme Normies. Dark themes are nice, but I like Light Themes too (and my Dark Theme Normies). I'm currently trying new things out. Sorry in advance if I made your eyes bleed. I might tweak some of them as time goes on, still not 100% on what looks good & also is a fun color.

**6 New Light Themes!**

- Tired & broken down programmers rejoice! Even though you will never be pampered by a real Fox-demigod, you can now at least code with one. Let "The Helpful Fox Senko-san" watch over you as complete your tickets. You can almost feel the "おかえりなのじゃ" you will never get 😭
- I decided to complete my Quintessential Quintuplets collection by adding the oldest and youngest quint: Nakano Ichika & Nakano Itsuki.
- Tomori Nao, from Charlotte, has an interesting dichotomy when it comes to her personality. She is super cute tho.

- Added a link to install [Theme Randomizer](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16107-theme-randomizer) from settings.

#### Motivation

I am in a position where I will now regularly be using my light themes more often. I am also planning on adding more.
Most of my light themes were created a long time ago and my tastes have evolved over time.
I have taken the time to revisit a fair number of my legacy themes, light and dark.
If you want the old syntax highlighting back, then feel free to reach
out [in this discussion thread](https://github.com/doki-theme/doki-theme-jetbrains/discussions/509).
I will provide you assets and instructions on how to revert the color scheme back.

Thank you for your understanding!

- After that, is the smug smile of Yukihira Soma from Shokugeki no Soma.
- Lastly, I am going to be honest, I haven't seen Haikyu. I just wanted a Indigo & Orange based theme. So here is Hinata
  Shoyo.

If something was removed that you miss, please make an issue. I'll do my best to accommodate.

for any inconveniences this may cause.
