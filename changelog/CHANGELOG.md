# 5.0.0

### Complete Theme Re-Write

All themes have been redesigned. Newer, Simpler, Better!

- Brand new Look and feel!
  - Same Characters, cleaner look!
  - New Icons! (JetBrains defaults with a twist)
  - New Code Color Schemes!
    - Hopefully more readable! (Please reach out if you have issues)
- Enhanced User Experience
  - Clean Theme Switching
  - Minimum Work Configurations
  - Plays well with other non-Doki look and feels.
  - Less Glitchy and more color consistent.
  - Fancy Theme Transition Animations.
  - Dark themes in place of "Dark Mode"
    - Dark themes are still there, but they are their own theme now
      (eg Dark Monika, Dark Yuri). Same goes for light themes, for example: "Light Monika" and "Light Natsuki"

**File Colors may need to be re-enabled if you had them enabled**

If something was removed that you miss, please make an issue. I'll do my best to accommodate.

The Doki Theme is no longer built on top of Material UI, so all inherited configurations are now gone.

The Doki Theme no longer supports Material UI integrations. So both themes can not be cleanly used side by side. Sorry
for any inconveniences this may cause.
