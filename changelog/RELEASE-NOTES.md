# Holiday Release!

**3 New Dark Themes!**

- Celebrate Christmas with Chocola from the NekoPara Series!
  _I lied about Shigure being the last addition from NekoPara._

- The 4th of July now just got even better, now that you can code with Essex from Azur Lane.
  If you prefer a more canon experience, Essex's theme also has **secondary content** with the Eagle Union branding.

- Even though I missed this year's Halloween, I've got something to look forward to in 2022.
  Yotsuba, from The Quintessential Quintuplets, isn't 2spooky4me.
